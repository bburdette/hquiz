---------------- try it out ----------------
build with ghc:

ghc assocQuiz.hs

then try one of the existing quizzes:

./assocQuiz quizzes/elements my_elements.stats

----------------- more info ----------------

 assocQuiz takes two files as arguments:
1) a file of quiz items
2) a stats file 

The quiz items file should be a list of questions and answers on alternate lines, for instance:
color of bricks
red
color of pavement
grey
color of bark
brown

if the stats file exists, then assocQuiz will read it in.  otherwise it will create a new file.

The stats file tracks which question-answer pairs have been quizzed, and ranks them in order of their score.  Pairs with high scores are more likely to be asked again. 

The flipFile utility allows you to reverse the order of the quiz file.  Depending on the quiz that might be more or less useful, for instance the color example above becomes:
red
color of bricks
grey
color of pavement
brown
color of bark
