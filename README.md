commandline apps for memorization

assocQuiz uses a simple file format for quiz items - alternating lines in the text file are questions and answers.

multQuiz generates a multiplication table quiz based on command line arguments.  

Both programs keep stats on your answers.  Questions are more or less likely to be asked based on your previous answers.
